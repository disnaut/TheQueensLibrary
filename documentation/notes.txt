This is where I will keep my notes from this point onward.

What I want ServerInit to do:
  1. Download the hash file for the database we are using
      NOTE: If I download and check the hash, I can determine if the database was updated or not.
  2. Check to see if the database exists, download if it doesn't
  3. Check the hash between the hashfile that was downloaded,
     and the hash calculated from the downloaded file.
  4. Check to see if certain tables exist within the database downloaded, create if they are not present.


What do I need to test:

  1. Download the hash file for the database we are using
    1.1 Does this file exist?
    1.2 Can we download the file?
  2. Check to see if the database exists, download if it doesn't
    2.1 Does this file exist?
    2.2 Can we download the file?
    2.3 Is this the right file?
  3. Check the hash between the hashfile that was downloaded,
     and the hash calculated from the downloaded file.


need function that takes in a string to determine if a file exists
need a function that will download a file based on a passed in string
